## Description

Write a function that takes an integer in input and outputs a string with currency format.

Integer in currency format is expressed by a string of number where every three characters are separated by comma.

Input will always be an positive integer, so don't worry about type checking or negative/float values.

### Examples

- `123456` -> `123,456`
