# Coding Challenges

Here is a collection of coding challenges completed for learning and experimentation.

Each group of challenges focuses on specific aspects or different methods of programming and has tests to validate the solution.

The programming language used isn't always chosen for efficiency (i.e. which one has the best tools to solve this specific challenge), but also for learning and fun.

Challenges|Focus|Language(s)
---|---|---
[Advent of Code 2016](../../tree/master/advent_of_code_2016)|- Explicitness, e.g. name variables in `if` statements<br>- Readability, e.g. avoid chaining and break into multiple statements<br>- Reusability, e.g. break code in small functions and classes for the second part of the challenge (only known upon completion of the first part) to reuse and avoid duplication|Python
[Advent of Code 2019](../../tree/master/advent_of_code_2019)|...|Python
[Codewars](../../tree/master/codewars)|- One-liners<br>- Exploring standard libraries<br>- Exploiting language quirks<br><br>Readability and explicitness are not sought, also comments might be present to help understand the code|Python

Additional notes can be found in the `README` of each group or challenge.
